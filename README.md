# Using JavaScript to create classic games! 
## A code along practice from https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-javascript-by-building-7-games-video-course/

### Games to be created will be:
1. Memory Game
    * Functions used:
      - push()
      - querySelector()
      - setAttribute()
      - getAttribute()
      - createElement()
      - appendChild()
      - Math.random()
      - sort()
      - for loops

    * To re-do in React, what changes would I make?
      - Allow user to select size of their grid (difficulty levels)
      - Add reset button
      - Add timer
      - Add high score board
      - Add different scoring options
        - Score increases by getting matches, win once all are found, try to get the quickest time
        - Score increases on click, try to get the lowest score possible
        - Chose a set number of clicks, lose once you run out of clicks (num of clicks could vary by difficulty)
      - Add different card themes
